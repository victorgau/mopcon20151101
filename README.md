## scripts and files presented in Mopcon 2015 unconference

The iPython notebook is to show the tools we need to create static maps.  Specifically, Requests is used to get the map tile from the Internet, and PIL is used to stitch the map tiles.  Images used in the iPython notebook are also to promote PyCon TW 2016.
